-- trying to familier with stream.
-- first I tried to get head of a stream. We will need this operation on the way to dedekind's cut.
-- from now on i will keep updating in this file.

module pr13 where

data Stream (A : Set ) : Set where
    _::_ : A → ∞ (Stream A) → Stream A

head : ∀ {A} → Stream A → A
head (x :: xs) = x

enum : ℤ → Stream ℤ
enum n = n :: (♯ enum (suc n))

num : ℤ
num = + 4

ex : Stream ℤ
ex = enum num

--type control c control n head ex
-- result = + 4

-- Now i am thinking to write filter function.
